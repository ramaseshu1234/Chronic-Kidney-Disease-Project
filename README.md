# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Project
Data Description about the project:

A Novel Methodology for  Diagnosing  Chronic Kidney Disease using ML is simulation based web application which aims to read the
patient data that is collected from the clinical laboratories and predict the chances of having the Kidney Disease and to diagnose them
at an early stage.
	The Execution Model uses the Adaboost Machine Learning Technique as a primary technique which resulted higher accuracy to
 predict the outcome about CKD  than the other ML techniques.

The Execution of the Project is as follows: 

-Open The Folder in which the project related files have been stored.
-Copy The Address of the Folder
-Check Whether Anaconda Prompt has been installed or not
-If Not,Install Anaconda Prompt and follow up the process
-Change the Directory using 'cd' command and paste the address that was copied earlier
-Run the 'app.py' file using 'python'   
command
-Wait For Anaconda to prompt the link address after the loading of files
-Once the web address appears,copy the address and paste it in the browser
-Register if new or Log In with your credintials 
-Enter the Data of the Patient and Submit to view the result
-The Result is Displayed on the Result Page whether patient is diagnosed with CKD or Not
